##Welcome to Wakanda##

This is the first step application to validate the resetDataStoreJournal API().
It must be run first. Its purpose is to test resetDataStoreJournal() in varios configuration.
Ultimately, resetDataStoreJournal is called on *testResetDataStoreJournalStep1* application's datastore.

Then this application is closed and testResetDataStoreJournalStep1 is launched and validates that its journal
has been properly reset.
