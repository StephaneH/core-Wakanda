##Welcome to Wakanda##

This is the last step application to validate the resetDataStoreJournal API().
It must be run after testResetDataStoreJournalStep0, in order to verify that:
 - the reset journal is properly generated (if the application does not start, the test fails)
 - the reset journal contains only the open data operation (as a result of proper journal opening by the application)
